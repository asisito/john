                <h2>Challanges of Cloud Automation</h2>

                <b>Complexity:</b>
                Complexity: Implementing automation in the cloud often involves integrating various tools, services, and
                platforms. Managing this complexity can be challenging, especially for organizations with heterogeneous
                IT environments.</li>
                <h1></h1>
                <b>Security:</b>
                is a significant concern in cloud environments. Automating processes can potentially introduce security
                vulnerabilities if not implemented correctly. Ensuring secure access controls, encryption, and
                compliance with regulations is vital..</li>
                <h1></h1>
                <b>Resource Management:</b>
                Resource Management: Optimizing resource allocation and utilization is essential for cost-effectiveness
                in the cloud. However, automating resource management requires careful planning to avoid
                under-provisioning or over-provisioning resources, which can lead to increased costs or performance
                issues.</li>

                        <p>Cloud provisioning refers to the process of allocating and configuring resources in a cloud
                            computing environment to meet the requirements of an application or workload. It involves
                            provisioning various types of resources, such as virtual machines, storage, networking
                            components, and other services, to support the deployment and operation of applications in
                            the cloud.</p>
